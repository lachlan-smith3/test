	<p><em>Name:          </em>Lachlan Smith</p>

	<h2>A little more personal information:</h2>
	<p>I grew up on the east coast of Australia, spending most of my time at the beach. I am a profficient swimmer and spend some time as a lifeguard when I was younger. I joined the Army out of school and have served on operations within Australia, Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirites.</p>
	<p>My hobbies include surfing and working on classic british cars, I own two 1960's Morris Mini's and my brother owns a 1959 Austin Helaey Sprite. The love of classic British cars stem from my grandfather teaching me how to work on them as a young child.</p>

	<h2>My interest in Information Technology (IT)</h2>
	<p>My interest in the world of IT has stemmed from how "plugged in" we are as a society now. The internet is no longer seen as "an escape from reality", the world outside is now seen as "an escape from the internet". It is this perspective shift which has made me realize that any sort of management 
	 job would require a greater understanding of how we interact with technology and how it infuences us. My experience with the world of IT so far has been quite limited, my job requires me to use and integrated logistic application for ordering parts and recording repairs and labour hours. 
	I have an Iphone which allows me to interact with the internet in a multitude of ways. I have never peaked further into the world other than being an end user of the technology to this point.</p>
	<p>I have chosen to study a Bach of Information of Technology through OUA and thus RMIT so that when my body is unable to keep up with the physical demmands of being a diesel mechanic I can transfer into being a workshop manager. Being a workshop manager involves alot of time behind the computer 
	learning new maintenance systems, updating websites, liasing with developers and training staff in the systems. Having a firm understanding of IT and a degree will make me more competitive for the job and further promotions within the business.</p>
	<p>I expect to learn how to communicate clearly with the majority of software developers as to the requirements of any programs I may need, evaluate programms and if they are capable of fulfilling the requiresments I need and solve basic ICT problems. Through the subjects offered by RMIT I expect
	 to gain more experience in working in groups with different backgrounds and skillsets over geographically vast distances.</p>
